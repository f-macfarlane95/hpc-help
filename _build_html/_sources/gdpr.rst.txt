Where did we obtain your personal data from?

Your name, email address, host institution, and telephone number are provided by you when initially requesting an account or submitting information via an enquiry form or otherwise communicating with us in relation to your HPC account. Your IP address and other information automatically collected is logged whenever you access and use the system.


Where will we keep your data?
-----------------------------
Your personal data is stored within the UK on secure servers located in Huttonâ€™s sites in Dundee or Aberdeen.


Why are we processing your personal data?
-----------------------------------------
We are processing your personal data for the purposes of providing you with an HPC account, managing effectively your account and your communications with us, responding to enquiries and providing support in relation to this resource and your account. In relation to IP addresses, we use this to inform improvements to the website and for internal system administration. When we use your data for statistical and service improving purposes, we will usually anonymise your data so that you cannot be identified.


What is our legal basis for processing your personal data?
----------------------------------------------------------
When we process personal data, there needs to be a legal basis for doing so. We process your personal data largely on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our legitimate interests to manage user accounts and administer the HPC effectively, provided that your interests and rights do not override these interests. Where you have consented to us collecting your personal information e.g. through one of our online forms or by completing surveys, we will rely on your consent. Where you have provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw it at any time (see :doc:`contact-us`).


Will we share your personal data with any other organisation/third parties and if so, why?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. However, please note that when you are provided with an account, your username, name and email address may be accessible to other registered users. 


Will my personal data be shared outside of the EEA?
---------------------------------------------------
No.


How will your personal data be secured?
---------------------------------------
We work hard to protect your personal data and have adopted appropriate technical and organisational measures to keep it safe from unauthorised disclosure, alteration or destruction. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to us via the internet; any transmission is at your own risk.


How long will we retain your personal data?
-------------------------------------------
We will most usually keep your personal data for as long as you have an account on the system. We will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose we obtained it for or until such time that you withdraw your consent and exercised your right to request that we stop processing your personal data (if relevant).


Do we make any automated decisions about you or profile your personal data?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No.
