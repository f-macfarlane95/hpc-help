Requesting an Account
=====================

.. important::
  Before requesting an account, first check your eligibility using the information on the :doc:`organizations` page.

`Click here to request an account <https://forms.gle/dKAp2aCy2YnG26SAA>`_

Your account information will be emailed to you once ready, but there's nothing to stop you learning more about the system while you wait by browsing this documentation.

.. note::
  We'll automatically add you to our **everyone@ Crop Diversity** mailing list, which is used to inform everyone about exciting new features or changes to the system, scheduled (or otherwise!) shutdowns, and so on.

You can also join our Slack workspace. You can sign up right now via https://cropdiversity-hpc.slack.com/join/signup if you have a :doc:`organizations` email address; otherwise we'll send you an invite link when your account is ready.
